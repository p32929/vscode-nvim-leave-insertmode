# vim-leave-insertmode
This basic VSCode extension ensures that vim is in normal mode switching between text editor panels.

This is especially useful when using modeless key bindings for switching between editor tabs/splits (e.g `ctrl+shift+(h|l)`) or after performing a mouse sin to change editors.
